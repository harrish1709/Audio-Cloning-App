# üó£Ô∏è Flask Voice Cloning App (RVC Inference)

This is a web application that allows users to upload an audio clip and a voice model (RVC `.pth` file), and then perform voice cloning using [RVC (Retrieval-based Voice Conversion)](https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI). It uses Flask for the backend and a patched version of the RVC Python interface for inference.
